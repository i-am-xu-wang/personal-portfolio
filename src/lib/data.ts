  "Once upon a tech-time, I traded spreadsheets for code sheets, swapping the world of public accounting for the magical world of software engineering. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®With a Master's from Virginia Tech, I joined Dyson as a software engineer.",

But I'm not just about the frontend life. I've ventured into the enchanted forests of full-stack too. Whether it's the rhythmic flow of JavaScript, the ancient runes of Java, the pythonic spells of Python, or the commanding chants of SQL, I've got a trick up my sleeve. ",
